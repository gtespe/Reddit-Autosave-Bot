# Reddit AutoSave Bot
A bot that browses a subreddit and automatically saves specified posts.

I originally wrote this for personal use to quickly fetch new sales on r/buildapcsales,
however I decided to generalize it to work with any account on any subreddit.

To Run, make sure autosave.py is marked executable and run it.

Requirements

    Reddit account

    Praw for python:
        sudo pip install praw
